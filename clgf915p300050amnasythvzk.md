As a student who is soon to graduate, I can say with certainty that finding a job in this industry has been a daunting task. Despite the booming tech industry and the growing demand for software engineers, the job market is incredibly competitive, with hundreds of applicants vying for each job opening.

## The Problem

In my job search, I have applied to over 1500+ positions ([read my article about my first 1000 here](https://hashnode.com/post/clemycdss00f36knv46czezz6)), and only heard back from a few, usually with rejections or silence. It can be disheartening to put in countless hours of effort, only to receive no response from recruiters or hiring managers. This is especially frustrating when considering that some job postings receive over 200 applications.

It's not just the sheer number of applicants that makes finding a job difficult. Many entry-level positions require several years of experience, making it challenging for new graduates and boot camp attendees to break into the industry. Even though boot camps teach a range of skills, including programming languages and software development frameworks, many job postings still require a degree in computer science or a related field, which makes it even harder to stand out in a sea of applicants.

Unfortunately, the job search process can also reveal the ugly truth about the tech industry's lack of diversity and inclusion. It's no secret that there is a significant underrepresentation of people from marginalized groups, including women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals, in tech. While many tech companies claim to value diversity and inclusion, the reality is that it's often difficult for people from these groups to land jobs in the industry.

The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted. For one, there is often unconscious bias in the hiring process, meaning that recruiters and hiring managers may have preconceived notions about who would be a good fit for a particular role. Some tech companies may have cultures that are not welcoming to people from diverse backgrounds, leading to feelings of exclusion and isolation among employees.

As a person of color, I have personally experienced some of these challenges in my job search. It can be disheartening to see job postings that require applicants to fit a particular mold or to realize that some companies are more interested in filling quotas than genuinely valuing diversity and inclusion.

Another frustration in the job search is the lack of communication from recruiters and hiring managers. It's not uncommon to apply for a position, go through a phone screening and/or an in-person interview, and then never hear back from the company again. This can be especially frustrating when you've invested significant time and energy into the application process.

## What to do about this?

It's not all doom and gloom, though. There are steps you can take to increase your chances of finding a job in the tech industry. One is to build a strong network of contacts in the industry, including fellow boot camp attendees, alumni, and professionals. Attending networking events and conferences can be a great way to meet people and make connections. In the last year, I have made it a priority to create space for myself and connect with many others on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzobalderrama/) if possible even going to others' profiles and endorsing them or even leaving a recommendation can come a long way!

Another way to stand out in a sea of applicants is to have a strong portfolio of projects that showcase your skills and experience. This can be particularly valuable for those without a computer science degree, as it demonstrates your ability to learn and apply new skills independently.

## Resources to Help Build You Up!

As a help, I have curated a list of different videos and websites that can also help build up your portfolio and even ensure your skills are top-notch when it comes time to interview! Remember to use the videos as more of a guide and less of a copy of the exact code. I learned best from starting a project with the video but then personalizing it as you continue!

### FrontEndMasters (for students\*)

Using your student email you can create a GitHub student developer pack account. This will get you 6 free months of FrontEndMasters which has been a life-changing experience for me when it comes to learning and tutorial-based projects! Here are some of my recommended videos from them!

## Final Say

Overall, the job search for software engineering roles can be challenging and frustrating, particularly for new graduates and boot camp attendees. However, by building a strong network, developing a solid portfolio, and remaining persistent, I'm assuming this is how we all are going to break into the industry and land our dream job.
